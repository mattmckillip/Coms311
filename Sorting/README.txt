I have implemented all 4 parts. Each part has a separate Java class. 
In each the main method of the part class will find the 1000ms element, 
then calculate all of the times and finally output with System.Out.Println().

For the sorting algorithms with worst and random case, a boolean flag called worstCase
is a variable that can be updated in each part class.

Each class is included in the package homework3

Finally I have included a test JUNIT class which should clear up any questions remaining.
